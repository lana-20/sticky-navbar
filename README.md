In this project, I am creating a sticky nav, something simple but useful.
There is a nav bar at the top of the website. I also have a hero image with an overlay.
I am styling the website a bit, but the main point is the nav bar at the top.
When you scroll down and hit a certain point, it does a few things.
It changes its color and the text color. And it lessens the padding and makes it smaller.
If you go back to the top, it turns black and adds that padding.
You can see this effect in a lot of different websites.
